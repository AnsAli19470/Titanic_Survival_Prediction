# Titanic_Survival_PredictionTitanic Survival Prediction
**Project Overview**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of passenger survival on the Titanic based on historical data. This project utilizes machine learning models to analyze various features of passengers and predict whether they survived or not. The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about passengers, including their demographics and ticket details.

**Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on the provided features. The project involves several stages, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle Titanic competition and includes the following files:

train.csv: Contains training data with features and survival labels. This file is used to train the machine learning models.
test.csv: Contains test data with features only. The survival outcomes for this file are to be predicted using the trained models.
The dataset includes features such as:

Passenger ID
Passenger class
Name
Sex
Age
Sibling/Spouse Count
Parent/Child Count
Ticket Number
Fare
Cabin
Embarked Port
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for model training. This phase involves:

**Handling Missing Values:** Addressing missing data in features such as age, cabin, and embarked port.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical features (e.g., sex, embarked port) into numerical representations.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance (e.g., extracting titles from names, grouping ages into bins).
Normalization and Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to ensure uniformity.
Model Building
The project employs several machine learning models to predict survival:

Logistic Regression: A simple model used as a baseline for comparison.
Decision Tree Classifier: A model that captures complex relationships through decision-making processes.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy and robustness.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: An advanced ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors from previous models.
Models are trained on the training data and evaluated based on their performance metrics.

**Evaluation**
Model performance is assessed using several metrics to determine the effectiveness of each model:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total predictions.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
Evaluation helps in selecting the best-performing model based on its ability to correctly predict passenger survival.

**Usage**
After training and evaluating the models, the best-performing model can be used to make predictions on new passenger data. The process involves preparing input data in the required format, loading the trained model, and generating survival predictions for the new data.
